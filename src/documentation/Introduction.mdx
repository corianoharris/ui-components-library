# Weclome to the UI Library

The UI Library was created to help us build products for our customers more efficiently. Established to be the single source of truth for product teams working on products across the globe, the UI Library contains everything from Getting Started guides through to Core Components intended for adoption within each product. It enables product teams to design and develop with speed, consistency, and quality. This will us meet the needs of our designers, developers, and customers.
