# Design Tokens Documentation

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are a set of reusable, platform-agnostic building blocks representing visual design decisions made in a design system. These include colors, typography, spacing, and more. Using design tokens promotes consistency across applications and ensures a unified visual identity.

## Getting Design Tokens from NPM

Our design tokens are available as an npm package for easy integration into your projects. To install the package, run:

```
    bash
    npm install @company/design-tokens  
```

## Visualizing Design Tokens

This tool allows you to explore and understand the available design tokens, providing a visual representation of colors, typography, and other design elements.

## Applying Design Tokens in Your Application

To use design tokens in your application, follow these steps:

1. Import the design tokens in your stylesheets or component files:

```
    /* styles.css */

    @import '@company/design-tokens';

```

2. Reference design tokens in your styles:

```

    body {
    background-color: var(--color-background);
    color: var(--color-text);
    font-family: var(--font-primary);
    /* ... other styles */
    }

    .button {
    background-color: var(--color-primary);
    color: var(--color-primary-text);
    /* ... other button styles */
    }

```
